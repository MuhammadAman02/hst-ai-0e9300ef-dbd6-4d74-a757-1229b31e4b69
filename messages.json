Let me describe what we currently have:\n\nThe main page (Index.tsx) already contains a simple \"Hello World\" implementation with the following features:\n\n1 . A large \"HELLO WORLD\" heading\n2. A subtitle that says \"Your simple app with a button\" 3. A clickable button that shows an alert when clicked This page is styled with a centere d layout, a light gray background, and uses the UI components from the project's design system .\n\nSince this implementation already meets the criteria of a simple \"Hello Worl d\" page, there's no need to make any changes to the existing code. The current implementation is clean, responsive, and follows best practices.\n\nIs there anything specific you 'd like to modify or add to this existing \"Hello World\" page? I 'd be happy to help with any adjust ments or additional features you might want."
